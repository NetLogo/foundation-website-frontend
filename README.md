## NetLogo Website Frontend
This is the frontend repository of the new NetLogo website.
Currently, the demo is deployed at https://netlogo.github.io/foundation-website-frontend/
The backend is hosted at https://backend.netlogo.org/

### Architecture
We use [Astro](https://astro.build/) to enable generate a static website from this repository.
This enables us to use React features, while keeping the website entirely static.
